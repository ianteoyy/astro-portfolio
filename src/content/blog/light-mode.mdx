I haven't had to create a light/dark mode toggle in my career yet but I've always been curious about theming. I am also really bad at color theory, but I found [A Simple Web Developer's Color Guide by Laura Elizabeth](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/) super helpful! As for color schemes, I picked a random one from [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co/palettes/popular).

After picking out the colors and testing them out, I set the colors variables in my css file and Tailwind config file

## The CSS and Tailwind config

```css filename="utils.css"
@layer base {
  html {
    --color-primary: 100deg 73% 85%;
    --color-accent: 30deg 18% 56%;
    --color-text: 30deg 18% 12%;
    --color-background: 30deg 18% 95%;
  }

  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    html {
      --color-primary: 30deg 18% 56%;
      --color-accent: 100deg 73% 85%;
      --color-background: 30deg 18% 12%;
      --color-text: 30deg 18% 95%;
    }
  }
  html.dark {
    --color-primary: 30deg 18% 56%;
    --color-accent: 100deg 73% 85%;
    --color-background: 30deg 18% 12%;
    --color-text: 30deg 18% 95%;
  }
  html.light {
    --color-primary: 100deg 73% 85%;
    --color-accent: 30deg 18% 56%;
    --color-text: 30deg 18% 12%;
    --color-background: 30deg 10% 95%;
  }
}
```

```ts filename="tailwind.config.ts"
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
  theme: {
    colors: {
      primary: "hsl(var(--color-primary) / <alpha-value>)",
      accent: "hsl(var(--color-accent) / <alpha-value>)",
      text: "hsl(var(--color-text) / <alpha-value>)",
      background: "hsl(var(--color-background) / <alpha-value>)",
    },
  },
};
```

I suppose there's a ton of ways to set color schemes for Tailwind, but I liked this one since it allowed me to still customize opacity in my classes (e.g. `bg-primary-80`). Plus with the colors set in CSS, I could extend it past light and dark themes later on if I wished!

I finally got to implementing the theme toggle this week. Feel free to try it out on the top right corner of the page!

## The Code

The main considerations I had for my theme switcher were:

1. Initially use the user's default dark mode settings (either on their browser or device settings, without calling the `localStorage`)
2. Once a user changes the theme, the new theme is stored in the `localStorage`
3. Since `localStorage` is involved, it also had to work in cases where the user disables the use of cookies.
4. [Bonus!] It has cool animations when toggling (the degree or presence of coolness is subjective)

```ts
function changeTheme(toDarkMode: boolean, storeSettings: boolean = true) {
  const htmlElement = document.querySelector("html") as HTMLHtmlElement;
  if (toDarkMode) {
    themeSwitcher.checked = true;
    htmlElement.classList.add("dark");
    htmlElement.classList.remove("light");
  } else {
    themeSwitcher.checked = false;
    htmlElement.classList.add("light");
    htmlElement.classList.remove("dark");
  }
  if (storeSettings && navigator.cookieEnabled) {
    localStorage.setItem("dark-mode", themeSwitcher.checked.toString());
  }
}

(function initiallySetDarkModeSettings() {
  const darkModeStorageSetting = navigator.cookieEnabled
    ? localStorage.getItem("dark-mode")
    : null;
  /*
    if I didn't fallback to null, the code stops here 
    and the text in this blog would be dark colored text against a dark colored background
  */

  if (darkModeStorageSetting !== null) {
    setThemeBasedOnStorage();
  } else {
    setThemeBasedOnSystemPreference();
  }

  function setThemeBasedOnStorage() {
    const userManuallySetDarkMode =
      darkModeStorageSetting && JSON.parse(darkModeStorageSetting);
    changeTheme(userManuallySetDarkMode, false);
  }

  function setThemeBasedOnSystemPreference() {
    const userPrefersDarkMode =
      window.matchMedia &&
      window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches;
    changeTheme(userPrefersDarkMode, false);
    /* the 'false' flag is so I don't commit the theme change to localStorage */
  }
})();
```

The code itself wasn't the hard part of this little project. I feel like if I was asked to implement a theme toggle a year ago, I would definitely have overlooked the user's browser preference. I also would not have considered users who have cookies disabled.

Sometimes I worry about my skills as a developer staying the same but knowing that's not the case makes me feel pretty good! It's probably a good thing I have this blog now, so I can revisit these posts in the future and maybe improve upon them.
